-An implementation of the board game 'go' that I honestly can't believe works


Current controls:

1: switch to player 1

2: switch to player 2

Arrow keys: move

Space bar: place stone



The selection changes to red when it is invalid, blue when not

Works fine on the outside, the code is a logistical nightmare.
